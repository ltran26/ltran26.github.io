# About Me

## My Interests
    I love sports, particularly racket sports, such as tennis, pickleball and badminton. I also love to travel. So far, I have been to 30+ countries. I am currently in Vietnam while taking this course. 

## Websites that I Recommend
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - Fair warning - you will either hate Reddit or love it. I personally love Reddit because you can find almost any type of information here, from honest reviews of softwares, companies, products to games, books, etc... Yes, there are a lot of bots and fake contents out there, but you can usually spot those quite easily. There are also a ton of different communities that you can join depending on your interests. 
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) - I love airbnb because it allows me to easily find wonderful places to stay around the world, especially long term stay. I know prices have gone up in some places and hotels may be cheaper, but airbnb is still very convenience when you're traveling internationally and long term. The UI is intuitive and easy to use. They have great customer support. I prefer airbnb over booking.com or vrbo.
